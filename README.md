# dotfiles

Old-school DOS command line users often find the UNIX command line to be just similar enough to be really confusing.  To be honest, there's not a ton of help for it.

However, one of the things that will help are my standard dotfiles.  It's ok, you don't have to know what that means.  

Download the files that begin with periods (hence the name "dotfile").  Then place them in your home directory log on again.

A lot of things will have changed, including the fact that standard DOS commands like 'dir' 'copy' 'move' 'del' and 'cls' now work.

*NIX-heads should have a look under the hood at these files.  There's a lot of geeky goodness in there.

Old-school DOS users might find this YouTube video.  One of the nice things is that you can follow along with the commands.
